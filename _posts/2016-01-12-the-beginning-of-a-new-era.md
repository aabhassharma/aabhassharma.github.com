For those of you who know me, and for those of you who don't, here's a little background story.

## What I was trying to do
A couple of months (maybe years) ago, I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi. Quickly, that turned in to a B.O (board obsession). 
Pretty soon, I had 3 raspberry pis, a spark board, an arduino, and various microcontrollers. I set out on blogging the 
creation of a "smart home on a budget". The first few posts came, and then life caught up.

## Life caught up?
Back then, I was working at a wonderful little startup called OLSET, doing all things NLP and Infrastructure. Then, my 
friend Rod Begie (@RodBegbie) whom I had met at Hackbright reached out to me to come work at Sosh! Then began a new chapter 
of my life running the DevOps, Services, and Tools teams at Sosh! Pretty soon, Sosh got acquired by another awesome company, 
Postmates, and now I'm doing all things infra at Postmates! Thanks to all these _distractions_ my blog fell away, and my 
boards sat collecting dust.

## What now?
Now that my life is relatively more stable, I'm back to blogging, and home-automating!! And since everything was sitting 
collecting dust for a while, its time to start afresh! New hardware, new software, and, a brand spanking new blog!

Stay tuned!
